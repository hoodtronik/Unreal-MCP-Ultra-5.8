// CLAUDE-NOTE: Riot Crowd ships as a SEPARATE, OPT-IN plugin that installs as a SIBLING of
// BlueprintMCP. Both the separation and the manual install step are forced by measured engine
// behaviour, not preference. Two constraints, both proven against UE 5.6.1:
//
// 1. A nested plugin is undiscoverable. FPluginManager::FindPluginsInDirectory
//    (PluginManager.cpp:1163-1167) discards a directory's sub-directories once it finds a .uplugin
//    there. This repo's root IS a plugin, so RiotCrowd/ is never scanned while it lives here — it
//    has to be copied/junctioned to <Project>/Plugins/BlueprintMCPRiotCrowd to load.
//
// 2. Optionality cannot be done with #if inside one module. UHT rejects reflected types inside any
//    preprocessor block: "'USTRUCT' must not be inside preprocessor blocks, except for
//    WITH_EDITORONLY_DATA". Mass fragments must be USTRUCTs and processors must be UCLASSes, so a
//    single module cannot conditionally reflect them — the Mass link is all-or-nothing per module.
//
// Together those mean the only way to keep MassGameplay off the machines of users who just want the
// core Blueprint tools is a genuinely separate plugin they choose to install. Opting in is the
// deliberate act of copying this folder.
//
// Full evidence: docs/riot-crowd/UE56-MASS-API-FINDINGS.md §3 and §9.

			// types moved into the new MassCore module — FMassElement and FMassFragment (from
			// Mass/EntityElementTypes.h) and FTransformFragment (Mass/EntityFragments.h, which was
			// MassCommon's in 5.6). The headers still resolve transitively, so this manifests at
			// LINK time, not compile time: three unresolved Z_Construct_UScriptStruct_* externals.
